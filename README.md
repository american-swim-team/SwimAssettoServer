# AssettoServer [![Dockerhub](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/rom3dius/swim-assetto-server/latest?label=Docker%20Image&logo=docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/rom3dius/swim-assetto-server) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1033469547266703380?label=Join%20our%20Discord!&logo=discord&color=brightgreen)](https://discord.gg/swimserver)

## About
AssettoServer is a custom game server for Assetto Corsa developed with freeroam in mind. It greatly improves upon the default game server by fixing various security issues and providing new features like AI traffic and dynamic weather.

Race and Qualification sessions are in an experimental state and might need more testing.

This is a fork of https://github.com/Niewiarowski/AssettoServer.

SwimAssettoServer is a forked repository of AssettoServer for the [swim>](https://discord.gg/swimserver) server network. This is where we work on our custom plugins for the network.

## Documentation
For more information on configuration, admin commands, etc. also check out our [website](https://assettoserver.org/).
For information on the custom plugins made by swim>, visit the READMEs in the folders of the plugins or reach out on discord.

## Getting help
If you are a user and you're looking to setup a server, these plugins are not for you. If you're a developer I'm willing to give my two cents, but not much more, over discord.
If you're a user visit [assettoserver](https://assettoserver.org) and don't use the plugins in this repository.
